# Alexu

Software developer with about 20 years of experience in building solutions for web, desktop and mobile platforms

## Experience

- **Git and GitHub** (+5 years). The place where I host most of my code (some of it in private repositories), but also where I try to contribute to some open source initiatives that I find interesting.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio** (+15 years). I started to learn C++ and .NET on VS 6.0 when in high school and I have been useing this suite of tools for many projects ever since.

I use Copilot, Cursor and other AI assistants, but always being in control of what's going on, preferring to write the code myself and take all the decisions. No "vibe coding", just using LLMs to make work faster where it can do so.
